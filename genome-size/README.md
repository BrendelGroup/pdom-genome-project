# Genome size estimation

[Jellyfish][] version [2.1.3][] was used to count *k*-mer distributions in the raw genomic short read data.
The *k*-mer coverage *C<sub>k</sub>* was determined for several values of *k*: 17, 21, 25, and 29.
A linear model of *C<sub>k</sub>* as a function of *k* was fit to compute the estimated nucleotide coverage *C = C<sub>1</sub>* and genome size.
The *k*-mer histogram files have been deposited in the Pdom Data Store at `r1.2/genome-size-est/`.

## Procedure

First, designate the number of available processors.
This will run multiple jobs/threads at once to speed up computations.
For a laptop or a desktop, this will usually be 4, 8, or 16.
For server or HPC hardware, you mave have as many as 32 to 64 processors at your disposal.

    NumThreads=16

Next, download and decompress short reads using [iRODS][].

    iget -Vr /iplant/home/standage/Polistes_dominula/sequence/genome
    ls genome/*.gz | parallel --gnu --jobs $NumThreads gunzip

Then, count *k*-mers and produce *k*-mer frequency histograms.

    FastqFiles=$(ls genome/*.fq)
    for k in  17 21 25 29
    do
      jellyfish count -m $k -s 100M -t $NumThreads -C -o pdom-${k}mers.jf $FastqFiles
      jellyfish histo pdom-${k}mers.jf > pdom-${k}mers.hist
    done

Finally, estimate *k*-mer coverage, genome coverage, and genome size.

    ./size-coverage-estimate.R

Clean up huge data files.

    rm -r genome/ *.jf
