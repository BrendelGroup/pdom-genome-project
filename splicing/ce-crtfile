Any combinations of nine items (see below) can be used to
select the query sequences which meet the criteria set
forth by the logical operators and their set values.

Logical operators are one of >, >=, <, <= and <>, where
<> means the operator with the associated item has no
effect on query sequence selection.

You can select your desired query sequences by editing
the operator and its values in the table below.
