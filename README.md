# Overview

This documentation is a record of our work for the *Polistes dominula* genome project.
It was created to 1) serve as full disclosure of all of the methods, commands, and software used to produce the reported results, and 2) facilitate anonymous replication of those results.

## Data access

Raw instrument data and final data outputs are stored in the [iPlant Data Store][] under the path `/iplant/home/standage/Polistes_dominula/`.
All file and directory paths provided in this documentation are relative to that root path, which for the remainder of the documentation will be designated the **Pdom Data Store**.

## Using this documentation

This project is divided into several sections, with each section focusing on a single analysis or small group of related analyses.
Each section has a dedicated directory containing code and documentation specific to that section.
These resources can be browsed or downloaded at [GitHub][].

  - A `README.md` file (in Markdown format) is included for each section, which provides a prose description of what each set of commands is doing.
    This file is intended to facilitate interactive replication of results: typing or pasting the commands into the terminal and executing them manually to produce the output.
    (Note: a single PDF document containing all documentation was produced by concatenating all of the various README files into a single Markdown file and converting to PDF format.)
  - Each section also contains a `Makefile` file which includes the same commands as the README file, though without the commentary and in slightly different syntax.
    The purpose of these files is to facilitate automated replication of each analysis in batch mode.
    To execute this procedure for a particular analysis, simply change to that directory and execute `make` on the command line.
  - Most sections also include additional supplementary files, such as source code, graphics, or configuration files necessary for replicating the results.
    The purpose of each supplemental file should be clear from the documentation.

If you encounter any problems using this documentation or its associated files, please open a ticket with the [Pdom Genome Project issue tracker][].
